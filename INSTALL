Installation instructions

To install Pascal-p2, execute:

[Linux]

> ./configure
> make

[Windows]

> configure
> make

To access binaries in the project, execute:

[Linux]

./setpath

[Windows]

setpath

Note that you can copy the path set within the setpath or setpath.bat batch file
to your startup environment to prevent the need to execute this again.

You can then compile and run single Pascal sources with the command:

p2 <file>

The extension .pas is supplied automatically.

Note: Pascal-p2 has an issue where it tries to load the first character of the
input before the program runs. Because of this, it is usually necessary to
hit a carriage return to start the program.
